# Signal-to-Framework Mapping

Signal patterns for the scan skill. When you detect a signal in conversation, documents, or connected data, map it to the relevant frameworks.

## How to Use This Reference

1. When scanning a source, look for these signals (exact or approximate match)
2. When a signal is detected, note the source and context
3. Map to the listed framework(s)
4. Assign a confidence score based on signal strength and repetition
5. Check the "Updates" column to know which status files should be refreshed

## Confidence Scoring Guide

| Score | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 80-100 | Strong match. Multiple indicators or direct behavioral data. | Propose status update immediately |
| 60-79 | Probable match. Clear signal but could be situational. | Include in report, propose update with caveat |
| 40-59 | Possible match. Signal detected but context is thin. | Include in report as "possible", don't propose update |
| 0-39 | Weak match. Signal is ambiguous or contradicted by other data. | Note in scan log only, don't include in report |

**Key rule:** A single instance is a hypothesis. A repeated pattern (3+ occurrences or sustained over 2+ weeks) is a strong indicator.

## Adding New Signals

When a new signal is observed that isn't in this table:
1. Document the signal, source, and context
2. Map it to the most relevant framework(s) from `index.md`
3. Add it to the appropriate category in this table
4. Set confidence to "provisional" until confirmed across 3+ observations
5. After confirmation, set the confidence guide based on observed reliability
